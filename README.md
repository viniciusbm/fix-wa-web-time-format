### Fix WA Web Time Format


**UPDATE** (20th July 2022): This extension is no longer needed. WhatsApp has finally fixed the bug! 

<hr>Old README text:



This is a small extension that fixes the time format on WhatsApp Web.

For months, WhatsApp Web has been showing timestamps in 12-hour format
when the language is set to English, rather than the expected
24-hour format for locales other than en-US.
